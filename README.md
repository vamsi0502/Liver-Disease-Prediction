# Liver-Disease-Prediction

This project focuses on visualizing and analysing liver disease data using Python and R. The primary objective of the project was to learn boosting techniques and implement the various boosting algorithms on this data set in Python.

The data set was also particularly interesting to me because it was collected in Northern Andhra Pradesh in India, close to my hometown!

Objectives for this study:

- Understand the relationships between predictors and response
- Find the model that best predict the disease status
- Learn boosting methods and implement them in python
- Determine the most important variables for predicting liver disease

R codes as well as jupyter notebook containing python code can be found in this repository.
